  "dexa": {
    "full_name": "Dual-Energy X-ray Absorptiometry (DEXA/DXA)",
    "physics_brief": "Uses two X-ray beams at different energy levels to differentiate bone from soft tissue and measure areal bone mineral density (BMD). Low radiation exposure (1-5 microSv). Measures BMD in g/cm2 at the hip, lumbar spine, and forearm. Results reported as T-scores (compared to young adult reference) and Z-scores (compared to age-matched reference).",
    "clinical_role": "Gold standard for osteoporosis diagnosis and fracture risk assessment. T-score <= -1.0 indicates osteopenia, <= -2.5 indicates osteoporosis. Used for monitoring treatment response and guiding pharmacologic therapy decisions. FRAX score combines DEXA results with clinical risk factors for 10-year fracture probability. Screening recommended for women >= 65, men >= 70, and younger patients with risk factors.",
    "ai_applications": "AI-assisted opportunistic osteoporosis screening from routine CT scans, correlating vertebral body HU values with DEXA T-scores. Automated body composition analysis from DEXA scans (lean mass, fat mass, visceral adipose tissue). Deep learning models for DEXA image quality assessment and artifact detection. Integration with clinical decision support for automated FRAX calculation."

  "nuclear_medicine": {
    "full_name": "Nuclear Medicine (Scintigraphy / Planar Imaging)",
    "physics_brief": "Uses gamma-emitting radiopharmaceuticals (e.g., Tc-99m, I-131, Ga-67) administered to the patient to image physiological processes. A gamma camera detects emitted photons to create 2D planar images. Different tracers target specific metabolic pathways: Tc-99m MDP for bone turnover, Tc-99m sestamibi for myocardial perfusion, I-131 for thyroid function and therapy, Tc-99m MAA for lung perfusion.",
    "clinical_role": "Functional imaging modality providing metabolic and physiological information complementary to anatomic imaging. Key applications include bone scintigraphy (metastatic survey, occult fractures, infection), thyroid imaging (hyperthyroidism workup, thyroid cancer staging/therapy), myocardial perfusion imaging (coronary artery disease), renal scintigraphy (differential function, obstruction), and hepatobiliary scanning (cholecystitis). V/Q scanning for pulmonary embolism in patients with contrast allergy.",
    "ai_applications": "AI-assisted interpretation of bone scans for metastatic disease detection and quantification (e.g., bone scan index). Automated thyroid uptake calculation and nodule characterization. Deep learning for myocardial perfusion defect detection and quantification with improved risk stratification. AI triage for identifying high-acuity findings on nuclear medicine studies."

  "spect": {
    "full_name": "Single-Photon Emission Computed Tomography (SPECT)",
    "physics_brief": "Tomographic extension of nuclear medicine using rotating gamma cameras to acquire projections and reconstruct 3D volumetric images of radiotracer distribution. SPECT/CT hybrid systems combine functional SPECT with anatomic CT for improved localization and attenuation correction. Resolution typically 8-12mm, lower than PET (4-6mm). Uses same gamma-emitting isotopes as planar nuclear medicine (Tc-99m, I-123, In-111).",
    "clinical_role": "Provides 3D functional information with improved contrast and localization compared to planar scintigraphy. Primary applications include myocardial perfusion SPECT (stress/rest for CAD), brain perfusion SPECT (dementia, epilepsy localization), DaTscan (dopamine transporter imaging for Parkinson disease), bone SPECT/CT (equivocal bone scan findings, spondylolysis), and parathyroid SPECT/CT (preoperative localization). SPECT/CT improves specificity by correlating functional findings with anatomic structures.",
    "ai_applications": "AI-powered myocardial perfusion analysis with automated segmentation, polar map generation, and defect quantification. Deep learning for SPECT image reconstruction with reduced noise and improved resolution. Automated DaTscan quantification for Parkinson disease diagnosis. AI-assisted attenuation correction without CT in SPECT-only systems. Motion correction algorithms using deep learning."

  "interventional_radiology": {
    "full_name": "Interventional Radiology (IR)",
    "physics_brief": "Image-guided minimally invasive procedures using fluoroscopy (real-time X-ray), ultrasound, CT, and MRI for guidance. Fluoroscopy provides continuous X-ray imaging at 7.5-30 frames per second using an image intensifier or flat-panel detector. Digital subtraction angiography (DSA) removes bone/soft tissue to visualize contrast-enhanced vessels. Cone-beam CT provides intra-procedural 3D imaging. Radiation doses are higher than diagnostic imaging due to prolonged fluoroscopy times.",
    "clinical_role": "Minimally invasive image-guided therapeutic and diagnostic procedures replacing many open surgical approaches. Vascular interventions include angioplasty, stenting, embolization, thrombolysis, TIPS, and TACE for hepatocellular carcinoma. Non-vascular procedures include image-guided biopsy, abscess drainage, tumor ablation (RFA, microwave, cryoablation), vertebroplasty/kyphoplasty, and nephrostomy. IR procedures offer reduced morbidity, shorter recovery, and lower costs compared to surgery for many indications.",
    "ai_applications": "AI-assisted catheter and guidewire navigation using real-time image analysis. Deep learning for automated vessel segmentation during angiography. AI-based radiation dose monitoring and optimization during fluoroscopic procedures. Automated lesion targeting for tumor ablation planning using pre-procedural CT/MRI. Predictive models for treatment response after locoregional therapies (TACE, ablation). Real-time AI-based image enhancement for improved visualization during complex procedures."
